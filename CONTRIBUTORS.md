Special thanks:

* Lex Berezhny (LBRY Inc) helped me out with some database questions.
* Matt Pitkin (Lancaster University) inspired me to get this ready sooner by
being enthusiastic about it.
* John Skilling (MaxEnt Data Consultants) kindly gave me permission to use his
Random Number Generator C code and to include it in this package.
